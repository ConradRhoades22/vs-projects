            <p>My name is Conrad and I run Rogue Prototypes. Its my personal business that offers 3D design and 3D printing services. I picked up 3D printing in 2019 as a hobby and have grown it to be a second job that I enjoy. For designing, I have around the same amount of time and effort put into Fusion360 and other various CAD programs. </p>
